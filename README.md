# mask_vs_no-mask

Coding up the mask or no mask project to find if a person is wearing a mask or not. ðŸ˜·
Although the code is different but i used the dataset described in this blog post.
  https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/05/04/covid-19-face-mask-detector-with-opencv-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/
  
## SCRIPTS
This repo contains three notebooks, thier operations are pretty much clear by their names. ðŸ˜‰ 
so i will just be describing the data_preparation.ipynb

although there are many approaches to select the face areas speifically for training the model but 
i preferred to form a seperate dataset named as "dataset_cropped.zip", that contains the face crops of original data.

you can find it in data folder.

This is what i did in-short
